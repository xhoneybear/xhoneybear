# Hi! I'm Camille 🦊
I'm a person of science, pursuing career path joining biology and medicine with IT.
I am very interested in biological processes, genetical engineering and all things radioactive ☢
I am also an IT person with a thing for game development, simulation and UI design.

I'm neurodivergent! Because of that I often change the focus of my interests so there's not really a single thing that I primarily focus on. It makes it harder to progress, but I guess it doesn't make me all that boring 🤷‍♀️

## What I work with:
- 🐧 Linux
- 🐍 Python
- 🌐 HTML/CSS
- 🟨 JavaScript
- :octocat: Git

## What I want to learn:
- Kotlin
- Scala
- Rust
- Go
- Databases

### Work
I'm currently employed and working for Nokia. I'm scripting things ✍

### Contributions
I'm open for collaboration and contribution on FOSS projects! 🌱 Please reach out to me for help with your projects. I'd be very happy to help! 💖
